# vue-mdc-adapter-simple vue-cli boilerplate

> The simplest possible Vue MDC Adapter setup in a single HTML file


### Before You Start...

This boilerplate is targeted at beginners who want to start exploring Vue without the distraction of a complicated development environment.

For advanced features such as asset compilation, hot-reload, lint-on-save, unit testing, and CSS extraction, we recommend that more experienced developers use one of the [other templates](https://github.com/vuejs-templates/).

## Usage

This is a project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli).

``` bash
# Install vue-cli if you haven't already
$ npm install -g vue-cli      

# Create a new project based on this template
$ vue init stasson/vue-mdc-adapter-boilerplate my-project
$ cd my-project             

$ npm install -g live-server  # Install live-server if you haven't already
$ live-server                 # Run live-server and open it in your browser
```

### Fork It And Make Your Own

You can [fork this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) to create your own boilerplate, and use it with `vue-cli`:

``` bash
vue init username/repo my-project
```
